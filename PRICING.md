# Orgaflow Pricing & Plans (Draft)

> Goal: Use the **Decoy Effect** to make the mid-tier plan the most attractive choice.

## Plan Strategy (Decoy Effect)
- **Free** establishes a low-risk entry point with strict limits.
- **Growth** is the **target plan** (best value for most teams).
- **Enterprise** is the **anchor/decoy**: meaningfully higher price for incremental gains, making Growth feel optimal.
